Using the transcript or minutes of a meeting provided by the user as your primary source, 
craft a compelling news report of {str(article['words'])} words which captures the essence and impact of the discussed topics. 
A news report of a meeting is a concise, objective, and informative summary that highlights the key discussions, decisions, and outcomes of a gathering, such as a local government meeting. It goes beyond a simple meeting summary by focusing on the most newsworthy aspects and explaining their relevance and potential impact on the community. A well-crafted news report should engage readers, provide essential context, and adhere to journalistic standards of accuracy, fairness, and clarity.  

Using the transcript or minutes from the recent meeting as your primary source, craft a compelling news report of {str(article['words'])} that captures the essence and impact of the discussed topics. The news report should not merely summarize the meeting but instead focus on the broader implications and reactions to the decisions made. Here are the specific elements to include in your report:
1.	Headline: Create an attention-grabbing headline that succinctly conveys the main point or outcome of the meeting. Think about what makes this news significant and why it matters to the public.
2.	Lead Paragraph: Open your report with a lead paragraph that summarizes the key news piece from the meeting, focusing on answering who, what, when, where, and why. This should capture the most newsworthy aspect and draw the reader in.
3.	Context and Background: Provide context for the discussions, including any background information necessary for understanding why the meeting was held and the issues at stake. Mention any previous events, controversies, or decisions that are relevant to the current discussions.
4.	Key Outcomes and Decisions: Detail the major outcomes and decisions made during the meeting. Explain how these decisions were reached and their potential impact on various stakeholders or the general public.
5.	Use quotes from the transcript in qoutation marks to give color and reaction. There should be at least one such quote
    for the first and second most significant items.
6.	Implications: Analyze the broader implications of the meetingâ€™s outcomes. How will these decisions affect the future of the organization, community, or field? What are the potential benefits or consequences?
7.	Follow-up Actions: Mention any planned follow-up actions or events that have been scheduled in response to the meeting's outcomes. This could include further meetings, implementation plans, or protests.
8.	Visuals and Other Media: Suggest any visuals, charts, or other media that could enhance the report. Describe these elements and how they contribute to the story.
9.	Closing: Wrap up the report by summarizing the main points and perhaps posing a question or highlighting areas of uncertainty that could affect future developments.

Special instructions for quotes:
    text in quotes will be used to link the words to video clips so must be verbatim from the transcript
    quotes from the transcripts preserve any errors and informal language.
    They must be ABSOLUTELY word for word and letter for letter verbatim from the transcript. 
    Do not invent them. alter them, correct or abridge them in any way, even if they contain obvious transcription errors.
    People don't speak perfectly and the transcription may be inaccurate but you must NOT correct errors when extracting.
    for example:
        Don't change "30" to "thirty" or vice versa. Always use whatver form of a number is in the transcript.
        Don't change "gonna" to "going to" "have to" or "must". Preserve all colloquilisms.
        Don't remove repeated words or phrases.For example don't remove the duplicate phrase"the bridge" from 
        "it'll be expensive to fix the bridge, the bridge, even if we do it ouselves".
    If a quote contains a misspelled proper name, don't correct it and don't use it. find another extract.
    You may follow an quote which contains what seem like errors with "(sic)" to indicate that this is what was said rather
    than what may have been meant.
    
    Do not escape quotation marks with backslashes.
        
    If it is necessary to paraphrase a quote, make it an indirect quote  'speaker 0 said that...' rather than a literal quote
    'speaker 0 said "..."'. in that case put the verbatim text from the transcript which has been paraphrased in square brackets following the indirect quote.
    
Ensure that your report is engaging, factually accurate, and provides a comprehensive view of the meeting's importance and impact. This approach will help in making the news report informative, insightful, and relevant to the audience.
